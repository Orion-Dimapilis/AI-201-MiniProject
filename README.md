## Overview

Fake news has become a significant issue in today's information age. This repository provides implementations of two powerful machine learning models, Naive Bayes and XGBoost, for classifying news articles as either real or fake.

## Naive Bayes Implementation

The Naive Bayes notebook (NaiveBayes_Classifier.ipynb) demonstrates the application of the Naive Bayes algorithm for fake news classification. The notebook includes steps for vectorizing, parameter tuning, model training, and evaluation.

## XGBoost Implementation

The XGBoost notebook (XGBoost_Classifier.ipynb) showcases the use of the XGBoost algorithm for fake news classification. It also covers vectorizing, parameter tuning, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

For the implementation, I used the [Fake News Filipino](https://github.com/jcblaisecruz02/Tagalog-fake-news) and [Philippine Fake News Corpus](https://github.com/aaroncarlfernandez/Philippine-Fake-News-Corpus), which contains labeled examples of real and fake news articles.
